A demo app using Google Maps and Backbone.

## Requirements

An application that lets users enter a list of locations and shows them on a Google Map. The app should show the list of locations the user has already entered, letting the user update or remove them. The list should be saved to a database by the Rails server as the locations are entered. The front-end should be implemented with Backbone. We are interested in seeing how you use the following components. 

* JS usage with third-party APIs
* Backbone View, Model, and Collection usage
* Ruby on Rails usage including scaffolding
